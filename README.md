# Cocktail

[This web app](https://cocktail-uu4q.onrender.com/) retrieves cocktails based on the ingredients selected using the API provided by [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php). The top part lists three rows of common ingredients along with their images. For any selected set of ingredients, a list of cocktails using these ingredients are queried and displayed. 

The app is built with Javascript framework [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). The API query is handled with [axios](https://axios-http.com/). The styling is configured with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
